I’m someone who’s always been drilled by the power of play. Whether it’s video games, board games, sports, or theatre, I find ways to turn everything into an adventure. 
I'm a former preschool teacher who thrives on sparking curiosity and joy, both in and out of my work. 

## 🌟 What defines me?

- **Game Creator at Heart:** Ever since I can remember, I’ve been inventing games, treasure hunters, riddles.... These days, I’m channeling that energy into coding with Unity and Unreal, taking my passion for play to the next level.  
- **Theatre & Music Lover:** When I'm not coding, you’ll find me singing in choirs or performing in musicals. Acting, after all, is just another type of game!  
- **Fitness Enthusiast:** Crossfit keeps me sharp and reminds me that every challenge, like programming, can be a game if you make it fun.  
- **Passionate Educator:** As a preschool teacher, I’ve learned to use games to learn and make sure my work brings happiness to others.  
- **Lifelong Learner:** Imposter syndrome is real, but I embrace the challenge. I’m on an exciting journey, improving my skills and contributing wherever I can. This is just the beginning of a new adventure.
